God is more concern about His people; In _**Exodus 23:23-27**_ its written like, He didn't want His inheritance to serve the strange god, while He lead the people of Isrealite in the ways of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Cannonites, the Hivites and the Jebusites. He knew already that these people are not having steadfast mind, to stand firm in their Lord, who brought them out from Egypt. Also in _**Exodus 23:33**_, God warns the people of Israelite like if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.

Blessings we receive when we worship the Lord Jesus

\*He will bless your bread and your water

\*He will take away the sickness from the midst of you

\*He will not allow His people to suffer miscarriage or to be barren

\*He will fulfill the number of your days

\\* He will change His people to be God fearing

\*He will cause confusions among all the people, who were against the people of Israelite

\*He will make all your enemies turn their backs to you

And many more blessings, for those who are practicing His words in their lives. In most of times, we heard more about God, still our hearts are curious to practice the way of evils.Our God is the one, who hates idol worships. He is conscious more about His people,not to worship any other. We compromise ourselves to please the world and its words and hurting the Lord by means of our activities and our thoughts and becoming the worshiper of strange God in our life. Serving the world may be like some kind of addictions, committing adultery, our eyes on materialistic things, robbery, smuggling,murder, not honoring parents, lies and our revealed deceiving fleshy thoughts, mentioned in _**Galatians 5:19-21**_.Â  We need to leave out from the areas, that don't pleases the Lord. He also warns if we do according to the world, it be a snare and curse for us. We should be careful and not to be deceived. Also Its not like to please the Lord, to receive all the above mentioned blessings ; but to receive His peace, happiness, His love, care, His supernatural hand works in all our lives.
