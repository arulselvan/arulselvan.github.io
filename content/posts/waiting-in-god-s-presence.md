Sometimes God let us to wait. Here in Exodus 23:15,16 its written as _**"15.Then Moses went up into the mountain, and a cloud covered the mountain." "16. Now the glory of the Lord rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day He called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud."**_ Here God called Moses to the top of the mount Sinai, and there He made Moses to wait in His presence for six days. On the seventh day, God called to Moses.

Sometimes also God allow us to wait in His presence. Waiting in His presence would discipline us, mould us, strengthen us, cleanse us, help us to learn Patience, sacrifice and it will always lead us in the path of Cross. Here Moses was waiting on the top of the mountain for the Lord. Moses may not understand, why God let him to wait. God may called Moses immediately into His presence, but He made him to wait. Moses didn't know when God will call him; He might think it may be the next day, a week, a month or a year. Everyone who went with him and all the people of Isrealites may mocked at him for his waiting for God. But He was still sitting in His presence. God saw all his patience and the next seventh day, He talked to Moses for revealing some plans.

If God is making us to wait in His presence, its always good. Waiting in His presence, will never be wasted. Waiting in His presence, will always mould as a great person, that God wants to be. Thank God for every waiting moment in your lives and understand the purpose of waiting and one day God will lift up before everyone, who mocked at your period of waiting.
