_**“When doubts filled my mind, your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer.” Psalm 94:19 NLT**_

Yeah! It's easy to say that never doubt the strength and power of God. Here in scripture, it says like “When doubts filled my mind, your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer.” Psalm 94:19 NLT.

When we are in a situation where every door is closed, when our prayers are unanswered, when everyone puts pressure on us, when we are in the area of lagging; our human mind will forget God's promises and start doubting God's promises and we will lose hope and happiness. But we are worshipping the God, who always comforts us with His peace that the world cannot give. He is able to turn around every hardest situation in our lives. Nothing is too hard for  
our God. He won't leave us midway, He will lead us till the end. Though we are in a situation that couldn't be changed for a long period of time, we will believe that God will perfectly do it in His right time and we will wait patiently with renewed hope and cheer.
