Are you wondering about why God makes us to wait in some circumstances? We are living in the busy running world, we get everything instantly in hands, everything around us are easily reachable to any corner of the world. As we practiced living in the instant world, we are not in the mindset to accept delays in life. But God sometimes allows delays in life, its clearly well said in scripture 2 Peter 3:9 ‘’The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance’’.

Our God is a God who keeps His promises; He never leaves us until fulfilling all His promises. Sometimes the delays in our life may be like God forgot us and failed us; also we will come to the mindset that God is not with us. But, we need to remember that He is wonder working God; He is working behind the screens; He is more focused about our soul, than any of the materialistic blessings and any of our worldly desires. It doesn’t mean that He is not able to provide. If God is delaying in our life, we need to be happy that He loves us more than anything. If we give our heart to our Heavenly Father, He is able to save our soul and provide everything more than we ask in prayer. Lets we confess and surrender our heart to God, and get connected in His presence everyday and we will get shaped according to His desires
