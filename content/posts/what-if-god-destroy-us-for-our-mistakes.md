As we are living in the dangerous world, where filled with sins and evils. We are in the world where we are forced to do sins, without our willing. Even if we follow Christ, we don't have strength to overcome sins and worldly thoughts.

What will we do if God destroy us for our mistakes? Here its written in _**Exodus 32:14 " So the Lord relented from the harm which He said He would do to His people."**_Â Here God decides to destroy the people of Israelite for making a golden calf and they accepted it as their Lord and believed that it has brought them from Egypt. Many times in our lives, even after committing unforgivable sins before Lord, which makes God to think to destroy us. But we are alive, still living in this world, with all blessings from God. Its all because of Christ who died for us at cross, who always plead before the Father God for our mistakes and sins. Its because of Christ we all are living a peaceful life in this world.

We will plead for the pure heart and heart without any iniquities to the Lord. His only grace upon us will save us from doing multiple sins. Let us understand the pure love of Christ and His protection upon us.
