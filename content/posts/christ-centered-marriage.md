Love, the word itself more sweet than any other sweetner in the world. In Bible its written in _**1 Corinthians 13:4-8 "Love is patient and is kind; love doesn’t envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud, doesn’t behave itself inappropriately, doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails."**_ Its an amazing thing to show love towards one another. In this modern era, where the world is filled with love, many people undergoes divorce for various reasons is such a heart breaking thing, that we can't accept it. Many marriages failed due to hatred, misunderstanding and when the expectations are not fulfilled and due to various reasons. I thought like how relationship ends if there is love inside them. When we think of Christ's love on us, it always ends in sacrifices, even when we are not faithful. If we bring the laws of Christ love inside our marriage, it long lasts. Husband and wife, who are praying towards Jesus, their love relationship will be tastier. Even if they fight, it always ends in sacrifice. Divorce is a plan of satan to steal the glory of God in marriage.Before ending up the relationship in divorce, think of God's purpose in marriage and drop down the plan and come back in reunion. Husband should ask for God's help to lead his family and love his wife. Wife should respect her husband and obey to his husband's words. This always will please the Lord and He will be glorified. Both Husband and wife should have Christ as centered and if any other relations in their center, it always ends up in struggles and wars. Let the Prince of Peace, direct every families with happiness, joy and peace.
