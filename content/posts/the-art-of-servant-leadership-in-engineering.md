Leadership styles are dependent on the situation; different styles work for different situations. Let's explore in this article how servant leadership will help to build your software development team.

Before that, what is the servant leadership approach?

It prioritizes serving, empowering, and supporting others to achieve their full potential and foster growth in the team/community/organization. And the concept was coined by **Robert K. Greenleaf** in his 1970 essay,"The Servant as Leader." We can see his view in the below video

Alright Let's explore. Any software/product development culture is the core part, correct? This servant leader approach fosters a culture of trust, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Here are, let's see, the 5 points from this principle of how servant leaders help.  
**  
1\. Empowers Team Members.**

- Encourages developers to take ownership of their work and make meaningful contributions.

Servant leaders empower the team to set and achieve goals collaboratively, fostering accountability.

Encourages developers to take initiative and learn from their mistakes in a supportive environment.

**4\. Conflict Resolution**

Acts as a mediator to address issues constructively, fostering harmony within the team.

Maintains a people-first approach to ensure everyone feels heard and respected.

**5\. Fostering Trust & Collaboration**

Creates an environment where ideas and feedback are valued, leading to innovative problem-solving.

Fosters open communication, reducing silos and improving team dynamics.

Even with a lot of advantages, there are many challenges in the servant leadership approach. lets explore major 3 challenges and solutions

**1\. Balancing Authority and Servanthood**

- **Challenge**: Maintaining authority while focusing on serving the team can be difficult. Leaders risk being seen as too lenient or ineffective if boundaries and accountability aren't clearly defined.
- **Impact**: Lack of clear leadership can lead to confusion, missed deadlines, or lack of discipline.
- **Solution**: Combine empathy and empowerment with firm decision-making and clear expectations.

### **2\. Time and Energy Demands**

- **Challenge**: Supporting team members individually, addressing their needs, and removing obstacles requires significant time and energy, which can be overwhelming.
- **Impact**: The leader may experience burnout or struggle to focus on strategic priorities.
- **Solution**: Practice self-care, delegate tasks, and set realistic priorities to manage time effectively.

### **3\. Managing Low Performers**

**Solution**: Address performance issues constructively with empathy, while ensuring accountability and providing support for improvement.

**Challenge**: Servant leaders may hesitate to address poor performance directly, fearing it might undermine trust or morale.

**Impact**: Allowing low performance to go unchecked can demotivate others and harm overall team productivity.


**Servant Leader Mindset**:

**Focus on "We," Not "Me"**: Prioritize team success over individual recognition.

**Be a Coach, Not a Boss**: Guide engineers to solve their own problems rather than providing all the answers.

**Stay Grounded**: Balance technical leadership with emotional intelligence to connect with the team on a personal level

Example in Action: A servant leader in a software development team might:

- Provide resources and remove roadblocks to help developers focus on coding.
- Facilitate brainstorming sessions to incorporate everyoneâ€™s ideas in design and architecture decisions.
- Regularly check in with team members, offering mentorship and addressing their concerns.

By focusing on serving and empowering the team, a servant leader creates a supportive environment where developers thrive, leading to better teamwork, innovation, and successful project outcomes.

**Key Takeaway**

The art of servant leadership in engineering is about inspiring and empowering engineers to achieve their best, fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment while maintaining a strong focus on technical vision and excellence. By serving the team, a leader ensures that both individuals and the organization succeed together.
