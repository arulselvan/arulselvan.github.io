In our lives, when we would actually complaint?

When we didn't receive, according to our expectations;When we get some defective things; When we lost something; When we are controlled by others ; some kind of unbearable situation that we hate, we start to complaint.

Here in Bible, its written in _**Exodus 16:7," For He hears your complaints against the Lord, But what are we, that you complaint against us?**_ Most of the times, we are blaming others for our own mistakes. Here the people of Isrealites started complaining against Moses, that we are not getting anything to eat. They are not in the mind to remember, how God brought them from Egypt and they are not in the mind to accept, that the Lord is able to provide sufficiently. They were fearing that they would die in the wilderness and start murmuring.

But if we read this chapter clearly, it is mentioned four times, like God hears their complaints against the Lord, not against Moses or Aaron. They forgot that the Lord only brought them in the wilderness, not Moses and Aaron. Like the same, we also started blaming against the situation and people, as they have involved putting us in the situation. But we need to remember, its the God who put us in the midst of office pressures, any kind of abnormal situation in family and any unexpected situation before us. The one who created and allowed the situation, knows how to lead us in this situation and we need to understand the purpose of God in any of the hard situation.

If we are complaining against anything, Let us stop complaining and accept the God's purpose for us in difficult situation.
