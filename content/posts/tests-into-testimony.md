Our God is a God who can do greatest things, more than we imagine. His plans can't be stopped with anyone's disability. He promised in Exodus 34:10 "The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the Lord, will do for you." Hold on to His promise. One who is promised will never leave you until its fulfilled.

Whatever the situation it may stressing you, stopping to focus your goals, He is there to do awesome things for you. He is able to turn around any situation before you, where human hands can't do so. He always do good things for those who trust Him. His power is stronger more than we think. He will do great wonders among people, which would be the unbelievable thing for the world, that glorifies His name. So we always trust Him, in all our pressures, just we beleive that He is there with us, that He can do great things in our life.
