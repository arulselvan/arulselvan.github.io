Are you worried about why my prayers are not answered? Here is the answer in Bible that why God stopped listening to my prayers. If we read in _**Psalms 66:18**_,its written that " _**If i regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear."**_ Also in _**Isiah 52:2,**Â " **But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear."**_

We are living in the world of trails and temptations and our mind becomes the dark room for evils and sins and it also seperates us from God and at the end our prayers are not answered. If God doesnot hear us, we would feel so empty and we couldnot survive in this world. Even if we are tempted to live according to how worldly people lives; its written in Bible that we are not granted to live according to the world, because God has seperated us from the world.

If you are really facing this situation in life, ask Jesus for the strength to overcome every evils that struggles our mind and lets feel the presence of God at every single moment in our life and we will walk in the ways which pleases God.
