Are you doubting God when everything runs against you??

Many times in our lives, we are in a situation where everything will be against our decisions and God's promises. In James chapter 1:5, it's written that "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him." If we lack in anything, we can ask God according to His will and it is given to him and He is ready to fulfill all our heart desires. In James 1:6 it says that "But let him ask in faith, with no doubting". Here God really expects us to have faith in Him and not to doubt His power when situations were against us. When the situations are against our expectations, when we get an abnormal medical report, when we are met with a money shortage, when stumbling things happen in our family and in jobs; God expects us to believe His mightiness and He is potential to turn around our situation. Here it clearly says in the same verse that "for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind". 7."For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord."If we doubt God's power according to our situation, we could not receive anything from Him.

When Abraham cant believes the circumstances and physical conditions of bearing a child, the one thing Abraham did was, he believed the God's ability, and it became righteous in God's sight. If you could not believe God and you are doubting His power, let us be strong folded in trusting God that He can turn around our situation and He will be glorified through us.
