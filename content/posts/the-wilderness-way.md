Wilderness is always compared to dryness. No one likes to be in dry area or desert for a long course of time. Its the place where we cannot settle. Its always the shaking of our comfort zone. Its the place of thirst and wandering; also the place of fear, confusions, threatening dark roads; also the place where we cannot get any helps.

But in Exodus, God allowed the people of Israelites, the way of wilderness. Its written in Exodus 13:17,18 _**"17\. Then it come to pass, when Pharaoh had led the people go, that God didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near for God said,"Lest perhaps the people around change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt." "18. So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness of the Red sea".**_ So its easy for God to lead them in easiest way and also in the way which is nearer, but God redirected them in the way of Red sea, which means the great giant before them.While I reading this verse, I thought that whether God is good or doing the villain role in the life of Isrealites. Many times in our lives, we would think, why such a kind of happenings that we would never imagine? But its clearly mentioned in above verse, that inorder to save the people of Isrealites from backslidings, he allowed the way of wilderness; though going through the way of land of Philistines is nearer and easy too.

Even many times in our lives, though its an easy thing to provide for God, which we much needed, but He allows the some kind of wilderness to prove that He is protecting our lives from every evil ways, which would directly lead us to hell. In any kind of wilderness, where we all surrounded by every kind of negativity, which we don't want to experience in our life; God helps us to survive in the wilderness, making the way to come out of it, gives strength, transform our lives, equip and mould as a beautiful vessel and His name will be glorified by the people of Egyptians and Isrealites while opening the Red sea, when we accept wilderness in our life.

So, if you are experiencing any kind of wilderness in life, simply thank God and submit yourself to God and He will transform us, He will save our life from every evils that we dont want to be perish and He will be exalted before everyone who criticized you while He is doing greater things in our life.
