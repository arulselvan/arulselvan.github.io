Its not an easy pain to plan for abortion due to miscarriage, when actually conceived after years. Its more than the pain of labor. The pain may not be physically severe, but its of mentally. Its actually the end card to our happiness; fullstop to our dreams; the sign of closed doors from God. Undergoing the pain of abortion due to miscarriage, whoever the couples waiting for pregnancy to happen for years,its the heartbreaking moment in their lives. Some says it may be because of curses; some says its because of grace of not delivering the abnormality kids and rest others say what of bad things has been removed; and there is a strong possibility to conceive soon. Amongst all the worldly talks, its such a bigger thing for a couple to stand up after all wounds in their heart. Its one of the hardest situation, only ever God has to heal their wounds. It's written in **_Exodus 23:26,"_** **_No one shall suffer miscarriage or be barren in your land_** **_."_** Its also written in **_John 16:33,"_** **_In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world._** **_"_** Its a great challenges for every couple, who were facing like this kind of situation in their lives; One who called will never leave you empty. Also I encourage you to hold on to the verse and God's promises in your lives. Yes, its true the world will blame for every lagging in our lives; but the same world will appreciate, when God lifts us.So be encouraged, seek God and ask His guidance to lead us and ask God to give strength to overcome this kind of challenges. May God bless you!
