Are you trusting God or testing God in any of the difficult situation? Here the people of Israelite in _**Exodus 17:7, And he called the place Massah and Merribah because the Israelite quarreled and because they tested the Lord saying, "Is the Lord among us or not?"**_ They got disbelief on God, when they didn't get water to drink, where they camped in Rephidim. They again start complaining against Moses, they feared of dying because of thirst and forgot how God brought them from Egypt and how He sufficiently provided food to eat. They started murmuring that the Lord is among us or not? Here its clearly written like _**"Testing the Lord is like God is with us or not"**_. They would have seekÂ  the Lord instead of murmuring. This shows their disbelief on God.

In many times, in our lives when our prayers are not answered for long period of time; when we didn't receive the expected things, when we lost our loved ones; are we behaving like the people of Israelite? Or believing God without any complaints and murmurs?. Its not an easy thing to trust God when everything goes against in our lives. Still we have to believe the power of God, even when our prayers are not answered. It will bring the victory in our life.

If we are in the situation of testing God, we shouldn't doubt His power; rather we should have the strong belief that one who allowed this situation before us will not abandon us and He will deliver us, even if it takes time to get answers for our problems.
