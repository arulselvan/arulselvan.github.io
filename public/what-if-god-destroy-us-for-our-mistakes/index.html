What will we do if God destroy us for our mistakes? Here its written in Exodus 32:14 " So the Lord relented from the harm which He said He would do to His people." Here God decides to destroy the people of Israelite for making a golden calf and they accepted it as their Lord and believed that it has brought them from Egypt. Many times in our lives, even after committing unforgivable sins before Lord, which makes God to think to destroy us. But we are alive, still living in this world, with all blessings from God.
