Multitenancy is a software architecture where a single software instance can serve multiple, distinct user groups. or common infrastructure shared across multiple, distinct user groups. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings are an example of multi-tenant architecture
Approaches to Implement Multi-Tenancy Capability
There are below two types of approaches or a combination of both, used in the Multi-Tenancy
Application Level Infrastructure Level Application Level: In this model, a single instance of the application serves requests from multiple tenants. The application code is responsible for keeping each tenant’s data separate and making sure other tenants can’t see any data or activity that does not belong to them

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system just like any other version control system gives the developer power to track, manage, and organize their code. it’s very popular among the developer community because of its lightweight and branching capability. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge.

A branching strategy is a strategy that software development teams adopt when writing, merging, and deploying code when using a version control system.

Yeah! It’s easy to say that never doubt the strength and power of God. Here in scripture, it says like “When doubts filled my mind, your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer.” Psalm 94:19 NLT.
When we are in a situation where every door is closed, when our prayers are unanswered, when everyone puts pressure on us, when we are in the area of lagging; our human mind will forget God’s promises and start doubting God’s promises and we will lose hope and happiness. But we are worshipping the God, who always comforts us with His peace that the world cannot give. He is able to turn around every hardest situation in our lives. Nothing is too hard for
our God. He won’t leave us midway, He will lead us till the end. Though we are in a situation that couldn’t be changed for a long period of time, we will believe that God will perfectly do it in His right time and we will wait patiently with renewed hope and cheer.

Many times in our lives, we are in a situation where everything will be against our decisions and God’s promises. In James chapter 1:5, it’s written that “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” If we lack in anything, we can ask God according to His will and it is given to him and He is ready to fulfill all our heart desires. In James 1:6 it says that “But let him ask in faith, with no doubting”. Here God really expects us to have faith in Him and not to doubt His power when situations were against us. When the situations are against our expectations, when we get an abnormal medical report, when we are met with a money shortage, when stumbling things happen in our family and in jobs; God expects us to believe His mightiness and He is potential to turn around our situation. Here it clearly says in the same verse that “for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind”. 7.“For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord.“If we doubt God’s power according to our situation, we could not receive anything from Him.

One who is promised will never leave you until its fulfilled.
Whatever the situation it may stressing you, stopping to focus your goals, He is there to do awesome things for you. He is able to turn around any situation before you, where human hands can’t do so. He always do good things for those who trust Him. His power is stronger more than we think.

We are in the world where we are forced to do sins, without our willing. Even if we follow Christ, we don’t have strength to overcome sins and worldly thoughts.
What will we do if God destroy us for our mistakes? Here its written in Exodus 32:14 " So the Lord relented from the harm which He said He would do to His people." Here God decides to destroy the people of Israelite for making a golden calf and they accepted it as their Lord and believed that it has brought them from Egypt. Many times in our lives, even after committing unforgivable sins before Lord, which makes God to think to destroy us. But we are alive, still living in this world, with all blessings from God. Its all because of Christ who died for us at cross, who always plead before the Father God for our mistakes and sins. Its because of Christ we all are living a peaceful life in this world.

In Bible its written in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 “Love is patient and is kind; love doesn’t envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud, doesn’t behave itself inappropriately, doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.” Its an amazing thing to show love towards one another. In this modern era, where the world is filled with love, many people undergoes divorce for various reasons is such a heart breaking thing, that we can’t accept it. Many marriages failed due to hatred, misunderstanding and when the expectations are not fulfilled and due to various reasons. I thought like how relationship ends if there is love inside them. When we think of Christ’s love on us, it always ends in sacrifices, even when we are not faithful. If we bring the laws of Christ love inside our marriage, it long lasts. Husband and wife, who are praying towards Jesus, their love relationship will be tastier. Even if they fight, it always ends in sacrifice. Divorce is a plan of satan to steal the glory of God in marriage.Before ending up the relationship in divorce, think of God’s purpose in marriage and drop down the plan and come back in reunion. Husband should ask for God’s help to lead his family and love his wife. Wife should respect her husband and obey to his husband’s words. This always will please the Lord and He will be glorified. Both Husband and wife should have Christ as centered and if any other relations in their center, it always ends up in struggles and wars. Let the Prince of Peace, direct every families with happiness, joy and peace.
