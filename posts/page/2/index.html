Most of the times, we are blaming others for our own mistakes. Here the people of Isrealites started complaining against Moses, that we are not getting anything to eat.

Its more than the pain of labor. The pain may not be physically severe, but its of mentally. Its actually the end card to our happiness; fullstop to our dreams; the sign of closed doors from God. Undergoing the pain of abortion due to miscarriage, whoever the couples waiting for pregnancy to happen for years,its the heartbreaking moment in their lives. Some says it may be because of curses; some says its because of grace of not delivering the abnormality kids and rest others say what of bad things has been removed; and there is a strong possibility to conceive soon. Amongst all the worldly talks, its such a bigger thing for a couple to stand up after all wounds in their heart. Its one of the hardest situation, only ever God has to heal their wounds. It’s written in Exodus 23:26," No one shall suffer miscarriage or be barren in your land ." Its also written in John 16:33," In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. " Its a great challenges for every couple, who were facing like this kind of situation in their lives; One who called will never leave you empty. Also I encourage you to hold on to the verse and God’s promises in your lives. Yes, its true the world will blame for every lagging in our lives; but the same world will appreciate, when God lifts us.So be encouraged, seek God and ask His guidance to lead us and ask God to give strength to overcome this kind of challenges. May God bless you!

Wilderness is always compared to dryness. No one likes to be in dry area or desert for a long course of time. Its the place where we cannot settle. Its always the shaking of our comfort zone. Its the place of thirst and wandering; also the place of fear, confusions, threatening dark roads; also the place where we cannot get any helps.
But in Exodus, God allowed the people of Israelites, the way of wilderness. Its written in Exodus 13:17,18 “17. Then it come to pass, when Pharaoh had led the people go, that God didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near for God said,“Lest perhaps the people around change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.” “18. So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness of the Red sea”. So its easy for God to lead them in easiest way and also in the way which is nearer, but God redirected them in the way of Red sea, which means the great giant before them.While I reading this verse, I thought that whether God is good or doing the villain role in the life of Isrealites. Many times in our lives, we would think, why such a kind of happenings that we would never imagine? But its clearly mentioned in above verse, that inorder to save the people of Isrealites from backslidings, he allowed the way of wilderness; though going through the way of land of Philistines is nearer and easy too.

Are you wondering about why God makes us to wait in some circumstances? We are living in the busy running world, we get everything instantly in hands, everything around us are easily reachable to any corner of the world. As we practiced living in the instant world, we are not in the mindset to accept delays in life. But God sometimes allows delays in life, its clearly well said in scripture 2 Peter 3:9 ‘’The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance’’.

Google revealed AtScript at ngEurope in Pari. This is a superset of Microsoft TypeScript , ES6 and ES5. TypeScript adds types to JavaScript code and AtScript extends this idea further by adding annotations and introspection.
Google team writing Angular v2 on top of the AtScript syntax
Is it new language?
No, Its not a new language just influenced by TypeScript and Dart. Like how typescript is superset of javascript. Atscript also using similar kind of syntax but it’s a enhancement with what is lacking in previous. so it’s called superset for rest.
