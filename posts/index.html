  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Leadership styles are dependent on the situation; different styles work for different situations. Let’s explore in this article how servant leadership will help to build your software development team.
Before that, what is the servant leadership approach?
It prioritizes serving, empowering, and supporting others to achieve their full potential and foster growth in the team/community/organization. And the concept was coined by Robert K. Greenleaf in his 1970 essay,“The Servant as Leader.” We can see his view in the below video

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>What is multi-tenancy?
Multitenancy is a software architecture where a single software instance can serve multiple, distinct user groups. or common infrastructure shared across multiple, distinct user groups. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings are an example of multi-tenant architecture
Approaches to Implement Multi-Tenancy Capability
There are below two types of approaches or a combination of both, used in the Multi-Tenancy
Application Level Infrastructure Level Application Level: In this model, a single instance of the application serves requests from multiple tenants. The application code is responsible for keeping each tenant’s data separate and making sure other tenants can’t see any data or activity that does not belong to them

    <p>What is Git?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system just like any other version control system gives the developer power to track, manage, and organize their code. it’s very popular among the developer community because of its lightweight and branching capability. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge.
What is Branching Strategy?
A branching strategy is a strategy that software development teams adopt when writing, merging, and deploying code when using a version control system.

    <p>“When doubts filled my mind, your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer.” Psalm 94:19 NLT
Yeah! It’s easy to say that never doubt the strength and power of God. Here in scripture, it says like “When doubts filled my mind, your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer.” Psalm 94:19 NLT.
When we are in a situation where every door is closed, when our prayers are unanswered, when everyone puts pressure on us, when we are in the area of lagging; our human mind will forget God’s promises and start doubting God’s promises and we will lose hope and happiness. But we are worshipping the God, who always comforts us with His peace that the world cannot give. He is able to turn around every hardest situation in our lives. Nothing is too hard for
our God. He won’t leave us midway, He will lead us till the end. Though we are in a situation that couldn’t be changed for a long period of time, we will believe that God will perfectly do it in His right time and we will wait patiently with renewed hope and cheer.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Stop Doubting God&#39;s potential
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Are you doubting God when everything runs against you??
Many times in our lives, we are in a situation where everything will be against our decisions and God’s promises. In James chapter 1:5, it’s written that “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” If we lack in anything, we can ask God according to His will and it is given to him and He is ready to fulfill all our heart desires. In James 1:6 it says that “But let him ask in faith, with no doubting”. Here God really expects us to have faith in Him and not to doubt His power when situations were against us. When the situations are against our expectations, when we get an abnormal medical report, when we are met with a money shortage, when stumbling things happen in our family and in jobs; God expects us to believe His mightiness and He is potential to turn around our situation. Here it clearly says in the same verse that “for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind”. 7.“For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord.“If we doubt God’s power according to our situation, we could not receive anything from Him.

He is holding your hands in the period of seperation.

    <p>Our God is a God who can do greatest things, more than we imagine. His plans can’t be stopped with anyone’s disability. He promised in Exodus 34:10 “The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the Lord, will do for you.” Hold on to His promise. One who is promised will never leave you until its fulfilled.
Whatever the situation it may stressing you, stopping to focus your goals, He is there to do awesome things for you. He is able to turn around any situation before you, where human hands can’t do so. He always do good things for those who trust Him. His power is stronger more than we think. He will do great wonders among people, which would be the unbelievable thing for the world, that glorifies His name. So we always trust Him, in all our pressures, just we beleive that He is there with us, that He can do great things in our life.

    <p>As we are living in the dangerous world, where filled with sins and evils. We are in the world where we are forced to do sins, without our willing. Even if we follow Christ, we don’t have strength to overcome sins and worldly thoughts.
What will we do if God destroy us for our mistakes? Here its written in Exodus 32:14 &#34; So the Lord relented from the harm which He said He would do to His people.&#34; Here God decides to destroy the people of Israelite for making a golden calf and they accepted it as their Lord and believed that it has brought them from Egypt. Many times in our lives, even after committing unforgivable sins before Lord, which makes God to think to destroy us. But we are alive, still living in this world, with all blessings from God. Its all because of Christ who died for us at cross, who always plead before the Father God for our mistakes and sins. Its because of Christ we all are living a peaceful life in this world.
